                    <p>Wounded Warrior Project - Every warrior has a next mission. We know that the transition to civilian life is a journey. And for every warrior, family member, and caregiver, that journey looks different.
                        We are here for their first step, and each step that follows. 
                            Because we believe that every warrior should have a positive future to look forward to. 
                            There’s always another goal to achieve, another mission to discover. 
                            We are their partner in that mission. <a href="https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/mission"
